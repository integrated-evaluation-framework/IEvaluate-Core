# Core Implementations for the Integrated Evaluation Framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/integrated-evaluation-framework/IEvaluate-Core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/integrated-evaluation-framework/IEvaluate-Core)
The Integrated Evaluation Framework's core functionality and several default implementations of the API.

More complex plugins may need to directly interact with these classes, but dependency is discouraged as no guarantee
is made that non-API methods will be retained between different versions/behaviour will remain consistent.
